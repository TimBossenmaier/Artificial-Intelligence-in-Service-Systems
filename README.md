# Artificial-Intelligence-in-Service-Systems

The code files included in this repository have been developed during the university course Artificial Intellingence in Service Systems during the winter term 2018/2019. Within this course we learned to understand and implement the complete lifecycle of a typical Artificial Intelligence use case with supervised machine learning. Furthermore, AI has been appliedg within service systems, which allows multiple, independent entities to collaborate and derive insights.

Structure of the course:
  1) Initiation (Learning Lifecycle)
  2) Performance estimation and evaluation (Learning Lifecycle)
  3) Deployment (Learning Lifecycle)
  4) Concept Drift (Learning Lifecycle)
  5) Meta Learning (Learning in Service Systems)
  6) Transfer Learning (Learning in Service Systems)
